# Someday Club

A shared, ranked list for two: films to watch, dishes to cook, and things to do together.

- `index.html` — the whole site (no build step).
- `firebase-config.js` — the Firebase settings that turn on the shared lists.
- `firestore.rules` — the database rules: who can read and write, and what an item may contain.
- `PROMPT.md` — the prompt the site was built from.

## How sharing works

The first time you open the site, it creates your list and adds a private code to the address, like `…/WEBSITES/?club=k7m2x9qp4hra`. Send that link (or use **Share the list** on the page) and whoever opens it sees and edits the same lists, live. It works like a Google Doc set to "anyone with the link".

Someone who opens the plain site address without your code gets their own empty list, not yours. Your browser remembers your code, so the plain address takes you back to your lists.

## Setup (one time, about 10 minutes)

### 1. Put the site online (GitHub Pages)

1. Open the repo on GitHub, then go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Choose branch **`claude/someday-club`**, folder **`/ (root)`**, and click **Save**.
4. After a minute or two the site is live at https://benjamingabrielesquivel-art.github.io/WEBSITES/

Until step 2 is done, the site works but saves lists only in the browser you use.

### 2. Turn on the shared lists (Firebase, free plan)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com and click **Create a project**. Any name works. You can turn Google Analytics off.
2. In the left menu, open **Build → Firestore Database** and click **Create database**. Pick a location near you, choose **Start in production mode**, and click **Create**.
3. Open the **Rules** tab, replace everything there with the contents of `firestore.rules`, and click **Publish**.
4. Click the gear icon, then **Project settings**. Under **Your apps**, click the web icon (`</>`), give it any nickname, and click **Register app**. Leave Firebase Hosting unticked.
5. Copy the `firebaseConfig = { … }` values it shows into `firebase-config.js`, like this:

```js
window.SOMEDAY_FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "…",
  authDomain: "….firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "…",
  storageBucket: "….firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "…",
  appId: "…"
};
```

Commit the change. GitHub Pages republishes on its own. These values are safe to be public; `firestore.rules` is what protects the data.

## Privacy

Anyone who has your link can read and change your lists, so share it only with people you'd hand a shared notebook to. The rules block everything else: nobody can list other people's codes, and items must have the expected shape (a title of up to 140 characters, a note of up to 400, and an optional web link).
